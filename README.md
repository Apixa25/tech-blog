## Description 

[Visit the Deployed Site](https://nerd-nook-news-tech-blog-cbb4ae9fd90f.herokuapp.com/login)ðŸ‘€

Writing about tech can be just as important as making it. Developers spend plenty of time creating new applications and debugging existing codebases, but most developers also spend at least some of their time reading and writing about technical concepts, recent advancements, and new technologies. A simple Google search for any concept covered in this course returns thousands of think pieces and tutorials from developers of all skill levels!

## Learning Points 

The purpose for building this tech blog was to flesh out a full-stack web application. It includes a front end built using HTML generated by Handlebars templating. CSS for the styling. And a back end using MySQL for the database. Sequelize which is an object-relational mapper for Node.js was used to allow the site to connect to the database. Express.js was used as the API for the controller which allows for routing, middleware, and template engines. 

In addition to this npm dependencies were used to round out the functionality.  Bcrypt was used to hash passwords. Express-session and connect-session-sequelize were used to provide authentication.
